\section1 1. General Text formatting

This page shows, some text formatting features.

As you would expect, making single words \b bold or \b{multiple words} is quite
easy to to. Same for \e emphasizing single words or \e{multiple words}.
\br
Use \\tt for \tt{monospace} fonts.
\br
Use \\br for linebreaks.

You can also \underline{underline} text or mark \ins{some text as inserted}. Yes those are different things. For example one css style might tint inserted text green while not changing the color of a simple underlined though text.

Text descripting an \uicontrol{ui element} is drawn bold.

You can \mark{highlight some text} like you have used a textmarker.

Also you can mark \del{some text as deleted} or strike \s{some text through}. Yes those are different things. For example one css style might tint deleted text red while not changing the color of a simple stroke though text.

Abbreviations are also easy to handle. so the user can known the difference between a \abbr{KÃ¼nstliches Neuronales Netz}{KNN} and a \abbr{K Nearest Neighbor}{KNN}

\section1 2. Programmer specific formatting

\section2 2.1 Keyboard Shortcuts
If you want to highlight a part of your documentation as a keyboard shortcut, you
can use the commands
\list
\li \c \shortcut
\li \c \key
\endlist

Use \c{\shortcut{\key{some-key}}} for shortcuts consisting of only one key. For example \shortcut{\key{Escape}}.
\br
Use \c{\shortcut{\key{first-key}+\key{second-key}+...+\key{last-key}}} if your Shortcut consists of multiple keys. For example the well known shortcut for copying
content to the clipboard: \shortcut{\key{Ctrl}+\key{c}}.
\br
Another example with three keys: \shortcut{\key{Ctrl}+\key{Shift}+\key{P}}.


\section2 2.2 Math

\keyword including math

Mathjax is integrated. Inline formulas \math{y^2>2\cdot x^{\sqrt4}} are supported.

\mathline{\int_{x=0}^{42} x\;dx \ne \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{\sqrt{i}}}

\note You don't have to worry about html special html characters, because qdoc will escape
the special html characters like \c{<}, or \c{>}. So for example the qdoc code
\c{\math{a<b>c</b>c}} will result in the following formula: \math{a<b>c</b>c}.
\br
Instead you have to use double backslashes if you are using the
\c{$$ ... $$}, \c{\[ ... \]} or \c{\( ... \)} command directly. For example you need to
type in \c$$\\sqrt{n}$$ to get $$\\sqrt{n}$$



\section1 3. Miscellaneous

\section2 4.1 Images

\image qdoc/showcase/images/cat.jpg Look, a cat! :D
\caption I have downloaded this image from \l{https://pixabay.com/en/cat-silhouette-cats-silhouette-694730/}{pixabay.com}

Inline images \inlineimage qdoc/showcase/images/cat.jpg Look, a cat! :)
are possible.

\section2 4.2 HTML

\section3 4.2.1 \\div

You can easily add div sections to the html output easily.

For example, the following commands

\quotefromfile showcase/showcase-text-formating.qdoc
\skipuntil \section3 4.2.1 \\div
\skipuntil will result in
\printto \section

will result in

\div{class="alert alert-success"}
\b Yay, successfully demonstration of the \\div command :D
\enddiv
