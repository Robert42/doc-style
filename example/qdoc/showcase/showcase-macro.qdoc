The qdocconf files provided by this qdoc-style also provide some macros.

\section1 \\shortcut & \\key

\c{\shortcut{\key{some-key}}} will display some text as a shortcut \shortcut{\key{some-key}}.

For example \c{\shortcut{\key{Ctrl}+\key{Shift}+\key{C}}}  is displayed as \shortcut{\key{Ctrl}+\key{Shift}+\key{C}}

\section1 \\math & \\mathline

You can use math formular, like \c\math{42\cdot x^3 + \frac{\sqrt{t}}{2^n}} for a result like \math{42\cdot x^3 + \frac{\sqrt{t}}{2^n}}

\section1 \\mark

Mark some text,as if it was marked with a \mark{textmarker}.

\section1 \\s

Draw some text as \s{striked through}.

\section1 \\del

Draw some text as \s{deleted}. The difference to \c\s is, that one css style might tint deleted text red while a simple stroke though text will not changing the color of the text.
